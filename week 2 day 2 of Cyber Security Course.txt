week 2 day 2 of Cyber Security Course:

today we started by learning how to clone the repository in GitHub to git bash,
as well as how to generate an ssh key to grant access to other users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then moved on to define Virtualisation and its types.

Definition:
In computing, virtualization or virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

Virtualisation is the process of separating a sofware from the hardware.

A virtual server means that the server doesn't exist in a physical form,it exists in a virtual format.

Hypervisor (aka Virtual Machine Monitor (VVM)) works as an interface between the VM's and the host.


There are 2 virtualisation types, Type 1 Hypervisor and the Type 2 Hypervisor.
Type 1 Hypervisor:
the hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's hardware without the existance of any operating systems.

Type 2 Hypervisor:
The host's machine is running under a conventional operating system, such as: Microsoft Windows,
Linux, MacOS, etc. The Hypervisor in this type is just another software installed in the operating system
and it shares the resources with all the applications.

The more layers you have increases the complexity of your system and thus means a more vulnerable system!
This means that the type 1 hypervisor is a safer option as it does not contain an operating system.
This also means that the type 1 hypervisor performs better.
However Type 2 hypervisor is much easier to use.
Servers use a type 1 hypervisor.

We then moved on to learn about Linux OS.
Windows uses a TFS file system while Linux uses Ext4

----------

covered the linux architecture:

---------
At the centre you have the hardware, kernel surrounds the hardware, shell surrounds the kernel, and  
applications surrounds the shell.

Only the kernel can access the hardware.The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer's hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

The Shell is the interface between user, applications, and the kernel.

Bash/dash are examples of shell used in obuntu

Applications could be anything, python, emails, web browser etc

----------

Then moved on to Linux filesystems:

----------

A filesystem is the system that control how to store and retrieve the data (i.e. files) in/from the storage device (e.g. hard disk, flash memory)

Everything (devices â€“ hard disk, gps, camera) will be stored as a file name and be used and read as a file but not stored as one
Everything starts with a slash (/) wehn trying to access a file

---------

Linux Distributions:

---------

A Linux distribution is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.
some examples:
Red hat is commercial
Centos is community free, and we will use mostly online
Wont use arch Linux since it needs a lot of customizations, but it is very powerful if mastered
Will use mostly ubuntu and kali, kali more than ubuntu
Kali is used for cyber security professionals while ubuntu is used for normal users

---------

Linux shell is a text interface to your computer. 
Ofter referred to as the command line, terminal, consol, prompt or various other names.

Different ways to launch a linux terminal:
1. Activities/Start -> Type shell or terminal
2. alt + ctrl + t

---------

finally covered different types of commands used on the linux terminal.
